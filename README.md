📌 Project Description

This project is a desktop-based inventory management system designed to help small businesses efficiently track stock, categories, and suppliers. It provides a secure login system, real-time inventory overview, low-stock alerts, data visualisation, and reporting features to support informed decision-making.

The system combines a structured database backend with an intuitive graphical interface, allowing users to manage inventory operations, monitor stock levels, and generate reports in Excel and PDF formats.
